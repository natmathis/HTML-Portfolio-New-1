<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and curious individual with a passion for learning, creating, and solving problems. My journey has led me through diverse 
  experiences — from healthcare management and technology consulting to event planning, entrepreneurship, and creative pursuits like cooking.
  I approach every challenge with both strategy and heart, believing that the combination of thoughtful planning and genuine care produces \
  the best outcomes. Whether I’m developing innovative business ideas, crafting healthy and flavorful meals, or exploring new skills like DevOps
  and data engineering, I embrace each opportunity as a chance to grow and make a positive impact..</p>

<p>Resilience and adaptability have been guiding themes in my life. I’ve learned to see obstacles as stepping stones, using persistence, creativity, 
  and resourcefulness to move forward. My work spans industries and disciplines, allowing me to bridge gaps between technology and human needs. From
  building customer loyalty platforms to envisioning community-focused ventures like family farms or gourmet cafés, I thrive at turning ideas into practical, 
  meaningful solutions. I believe success is not just about achieving personal goals, but about creating value for others and contributing to something
  greater than myself.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I cherish my roles as a wife and mother. Family is at the center of everything I do, and my days are filled with
 balancing work, learning, and nurturing my son’s growth and curiosity. I love exploring new cultures through travel, food, and connections, and I carry that 
 openness into my work and relationships. For me, life is about blending ambition with joy — building a career that challenges me, a home filled with love, 
 and a legacy rooted in resilience, creativity, and care.</p>
